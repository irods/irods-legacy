	ibun		- Upload and download structured (e.g. tar) files. 
	icd		- Like cd, change the iRODS current working directory
	ichksum		- Checksum one or more data-object or collection from iRODS space.
	ichmod 		- Like chmod, allow (or later restrict) access to your data objects by other users.
	icp		- Like cp or rcp, copy an iRODS data object
	iexecmd		- Remotely Execute (fork and exec) a command on the server.
	iexit		- Logout (use 'iexit full' to remove your scrambled password from the disk)
	iget		- Get a file
	iinit		- Initialize - Store your password in a scrambled form for automatic use by other icommands.
	ils 		- Like ls, list iRODS data objects (files) and collections (directories)
	imcoll		- Manage (mount, unmount, synchronize and purge of cache) mounted iRODS collections and the associated cache.
	imkdir		- Like mkdir, make an iRODS collection (similar to a directory or Windows folder)
	imv 		- Moves/renames an irods data-object or collection.
	ipasswd		- Change your irods password.
	iphymv 		- Physically move files in iRODS to another storage resource.
	iput 		- Store a file
	ipwd 		- Like pwd, print the iRODS current working directory
	ireg 		- Register a file or a directory of files and subdirectory into iRODS.
	irepl 		- Replicate data objects.
	irm 		- Like rm, remove an iRODS data object
	irmtrash 	- Remove one or more data-object or collection from a RODS trash bin.
	irsync 		- Synchronize the data between a local copy and the copy stored in iRODS or between two iRODS copies.
	itrim 		- Trim down the number of replica of a file in iRODS by deleting some replicas.

Metadata:
	imeta 		- Add, remove, list, or query user-defined Attribute-Value-Unit triplets metadata
	iquest 		- Query (pose a question to) the ICAT, via a SQL-like interface 
	isysmeta 	- Show or modify system metadata

Informational:
	ienv 		- Show current iRODS environment
	ilsresc 	- List resources
	imiscsvrinfo 	- Get basic server information; test communication. 
	iuserinfo 	- List users

Administration:
	iadmin 		- Administration commands: add/remove/modify users, resources, etc. 

Rules and Delayed rule execution:
	iqdel 		- Removes delayed rules from the queue.
	iqmod 		- Modifies delayed rules in the queue. 
	iqstat		- Show pending iRODS rule executions.
	irule 		- Submit a user defined rule to be executed by an irods server.
